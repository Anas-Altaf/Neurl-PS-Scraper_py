The  decision  states  (for  the  odor  information)  here  can  be  thought  of as  stable  cycles,  rather  than  point  stable  states  typical  of simpler  neuro-computing  models.  Analysis  and  simulations show that a  group of coupled non-linear oscillators are  responsible for the oscillatory activities determined by the odor in(cid:173) put, and that the bulb, with appropriate inputs from higher centers,  can  enhance  or suppress  the  sensitivity  to  partiCUlar  odors.

The Boltzmann Perceptron Network_ A Multi-Layered Feed-Forward Network Equivalent to the Boltzmann Machine,"Eyal Yair, Allen Gersho",1988,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/045117b0e0a11a242b9765e79cbf113f-Paper.pdf,"The  concept  of  the  stochastic  Boltzmann  machine  (BM)  is  auractive  for  decision  making  and  pattern  classification  purposes  since  the  probability  of  attaining  the network  states  is a  function  of the network energy.  Hence,  the  probability of attaining particular energy minima  may be associated  with  the  probabilities  of  making  certain  decisions  (or  classifications).  However,  because of its stochastic  nature,  the complexity of the BM is fairly  high and  therefore  such  networks  are  not  very  likely  to  be  used  in  practice.  In  this  paper  we  suggest  a  way  to  alleviate  this  drawback  by  converting  the  sto(cid:173) chastic  BM into  a  deterministic  network  which  we  call  the  Boltzmann  Per(cid:173) ceptron  Network  (BPN).  The BPN is functionally  equivalent  to  the  BM but  has  a  feed-forward  structure  and  low  complexity.  No annealing  is required.  The  conditions  under  which  such  a  convmion  is  feasible  are  given.  A  learning  algorithm  for  the  BPN based  on  the  conjugate  gradient  method  is  also provided which is somewhat akin  to the backpropagation algorithm.

Modeling Small Oscillating Biological Networks in Analog VLSI,"Sylvie Ryckebusch, James Bower, Carver Mead",1988,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/1afa34a7f984eeabdbb0a7d494132ee5-Paper.pdf,"We  have used analog VLSI technology to model a class of small os(cid:173) cillating  biological neural circuits  known  as  central pattern  gener(cid:173) ators  (CPG). These circuits generate rhythmic patterns of activity  which drive locomotor behaviour in the animal.  We  have designed,  fabricated,  and tested a model neuron circuit which relies on many  of the  same  mechanisms  as  a  biological  central pattern  generator  neuron,  such  as  delays  and  internal feedback.  We  show  that  this  neuron can be used  to build several small circuits based on known  biological CPG circuits, and that these circuits produce patterns of  output which  are very similar to the observed biological patterns. 
To  date,  researchers  in  applied  neural  networks  have  tended  to  focus  on  mam(cid:173) malian systems  as  the  primary source  of  potentially  useful  biological  information.  However,  invertebrate systems may represent  a source  of ideas  in many ways  more  appropriate, given current levels of engineering sophistication in building neural-like  systems, and given the state of biological understanding of mammalian circuits.  In(cid:173) vertebrate  systems  are  based  on  orders  of magnitude  smaller  numbers  of neurons  than  are  mammalian  systems.  The  networks  we  will  consider  here,  for  example,  are  composed  of  about  a  dozen  neurons,  which  is  well  within  the  demonstrated  capabilities  of current  hardware  fabrication  techniques.  Furthermore,  since  much  more detailed structural information is  available about these systems than for  most  systems in  higher animals, insights can be guided by real information rather than by  guesswork.  Finally, even though they are constructed of small numbers of neurons,  these networks have  numerous interesting and  potentially even useful properties. 
CENTRAL PATTERN  GENERATORS 
Of  all  the  invertebrate  neural  networks  currently  being  investigated  by  neurobi(cid:173) ologists,  the  class  of  networks  known  as  central  pattern  generators  (CPGs)  may  be  especially  worthy  of attention.  A  CPG is  responsible  for  generating  oscillatory  neural  activity  that  governs  specific  patterns  of  motor  output,  and  can  generate  its  pattern  of activity  when  isolated  from  its  normal neuronal  inputs.  This  prop-

erty, which greatly facilitates experiments, has enabled biologists to describe several  CPGs in  detail at  the cellular and synaptic level.  These networks have  been found  in all animals,  but have been extensively studied in invertebrates [Selverston,  1985]. 
We  chose to model several small CPG networks using analog VLSI technology.  Our  model differs from  most computer simulation models of biological networks [Wilson  and Bower, in press] in that we did not attempt to model the details of the individual  ionic currents,  nor did we  attempt to model each known connection in the networks.  Rather, our aim  was  to determine the basic  functionality  of a  set of CPG networks  by modeling them as  the minimum set of connections required to reproduce output  qualitatively similar to that produced by the real network under certain conditions. 
MODELING  CPG NEURONS 
The  basic  building  block  for  our  model  is  a  general  purpose  CPG  neuron  circuit.  This circuit, shown  in  Figure  1,  is  our model  for  a  typical neuron  found  in central  pattern  generators,  and  contains  some  of  the  essential  elements  of real  biological  neurons.  Like real neurons, this model integrates current and uses positive feedback  to  output  a  train  of pulses,  or  action  potentials,  whose  frequency  depends  on  the  magnitude of the current input.  The part of the circuit which generates these pulses  is  shown  in  Figure 2a [Mead,  19891. 
The second element in  the CPG neuron circuit is the synapse.  In Figure 1,  each pair  of transistors functions as a synapse.  The p-well transistors are. excitatory synapses,  whereas the n-well transistors are inhibitory synapses.  One of the transistors in the  pair sets the strength of the synapse,  while  the other transistor is  the  input of the  synapse.  Each  CPG neuron  has four  different synapses. 
The  third element of our model  CPG neuron  involves  temporal delays.  Delays  are  an essential element in the function of CPGs, and biology has evolved many different  mechanisms  to  introduce delays  into neural networks.  The membrane capacitance  of the  cell  body,  different  rates of chemical reactions,  and  axonal transmission  are  just  a  few  of the  mechanisms which  have  time constants  associated with  them.  In  our  model we  have  included  synaptic  delay  as  the  principle source of delay  in  the  network.  This  is  modeled  as  an  RC  delay,  implemented  by  the follower-integrator  circuit shown in Figure 2b [Mead,  19891.  The time constant of the delay is a function  of the  conductance  of  the  amplifier,  set  by  the  bias  G.  A  multiple  time  constant  delay line is  formed  by cascading several of these elements.  Our neuron circuit uses  a  delay  line  with  three  time  constants.  The  synapses  which  are  before  the  delay  element  are  slow synapses, whereas the  undelayed synapses  are  fa.st  synapses. 
We fabricated the circuit shown in Figure 1 using CMOS, VLSI technology.  Several  of these  circuits  were  put  on  each  chip,  with  all  of  the  inputs  and  controls  going  out  to pads, so  that these  cells  could  be externally connected  to form  the  network  of interest.

Our objective is to investigate the ba(cid:173) sic characteristics of back-propagation, and study how the frame(cid:173) work of multi-layer perceptrons can be exploited in phonetic recog(cid:173) nition.

Our results are comparable to human performance. 
Early approaches in phonetic recognition fall into two major extremes: heuristic  and algorithmic. Both approaches have their own merits and shortcomings. The  heuristic approach has the intuitive appeal that it focuses on the linguistic informa(cid:173) tion in the speech signal and exploits acoustic-phonetic knowledge. HO'fever, the  weak control strategy used for utilizing our knowledge has been grossly inadequate.  At the other extreme, the algorithmic approach relies primarily on the powerful con(cid:173) trol strategy offered by well-formulated pattern recognition techniques. However,  relatively little is known about how our speech knowledge accumulated over the  past few decades can be incorporated into the well-formulated algorithms. We feel  that artificial neural networks (ANN) have some characteristics that can potentially  enable them to bridge the gap between these two extremes. On the one hand, our  speech knowledge can provide guidance to the structure and design of the network.  On the other hand, the self-organizing mechanism of ANN can provide a control  strategy for utilizing our knowledge. 
In this paper, we extend our earlier work on the use of artificial neural networks  for phonetic recognition [2]. Specifically, we focus our investigation on the following  sets of issues. First, we describe the use of the network to integrate heterogeneous  sources of information. We will see how classification performance improves as more

An Electronic Photoreceptor Sensitive to Small Changes in Intensity,"Tobi Delbrück, C. A.

The sensitivity to change8  in the intensity is achieved by feeding back to the input a filtered  version of the output. The feedback loop includes a hysteretic el(cid:173) ement. The circuit behaves in a manner reminiscent of the gain  control properties and temporal responses of a variety of retinal  cells, particularly retinal bipolar cells. We compare the thresholds  for detection of intensity increments by a human and by the cir(cid:173) cuit. Both obey Weber's law and for both the temporal contrast  sensitivities are nearly identical. 
We previously described an electronic photoreceptor that outputs a voltage that is  logarithmic in the light intensity (Mead, 1985). This report describes an extension  of this circuit which was based on a suggestion by Frank Werblin that biological  retinas may achieve greater sensitivity to change8 in the illumination by feeding  back a filtered version of the output. 
OPERATION OF THE CIRCUIT 
The circuit (Figure 1) consists of a phototransistor (P), exponential feedback to  P (Ql, Q2, and Q3), a transconductance amplifier (A), and the hysteretic element  (Q4 and Qs). In general terms the operation of the circuit consists of two stages of  amplification with hysteresis in the feedback loop. The light falls on the parasitic  bipolar transistor P. (The rest of the circuit is shielded by metal.) P's collector  is the substrate and the base is an isolated well. P and Ql form the first stage of  amplification. The light produces a base current Is for P. The emitter current IE  is PIs, neglecting collector resistance for now. P is typically a few hundred. The  feedback current IQl is set by the gate voltage on QdQ2' which is set by the current  through Q3, which is set by the feedback voltage Vjb. In equilibrium Vjb will be  such that IQl = IE and some voltage Vp will be the output of the first stage. The

negative feedback through the transconductance amplifier A will make Vp ~ V/ b•  This voltage is logarithmic in the light intensity, since in subthreshold operation  the currents through Q2 and Q3 are exponential in their gate to source voltages.  The DC output of the circuit will be Vout ~ V/b = Vdd - (2kT /q) log IE, neglecting  the back-gate effect for Q2. Figure Sa (DC output) shows that the assumption of  subthreshold operation is valid over about 4 orders of magnitude.

ROUGH SKETCH OF OUR THEORY 
In order to describe the use-dependent self-organization of neural connections  {Singer,1987 and Frank,1987},  we  have  proposed  a  set of coupled  equations  involving  the  electrical  activities  and  neural  connection  density  {Tanaka,  1988}, by using the following physiologically based hypotheses: (1) Modifiable  synapses grow or collapse due to  the competition among themselves for  some  trophic factors,  which are secreted retrogradely from  the postsynaptic side to  the  presynaptic  side.  (2)  Synapses  also  sprout or  retract  according  to  the  concurrence  of presynaptic  spike  activity  and  postsynaptic  local  membrane  depolarization.  (3)  There already exist lateral connections within the  layer,  into  which  the  modifiable  nerve  fibers  are  destined  to  project,  before  the  synaptic modification begins.  Considering this set of equations, we  find  that  the  time  scale  of electrical  activities  is  much  smaller  than  time  course  necessary  for  synapses  to  grow  or  retract.  So  we  can  apply  the  adiabatic  approximation to the equations.  Furthermore, we identify the input electrical  activities,  i.e.,  the  firing  frequency  elicited  from  neurons  in  the  projecting  neuronal layer, with the stochastic process which is specialized by the spatial  correlation function  Ckp;k'  p'.  Here,  k  and  k'  represent  the  positions  of the  neurons  in  the  projecting  layer.  II  stands  for  different  pathways  such  as  ipsilateral  or  contralateral,  on-center  or  off-center,  colour  specific  or  nonspecific  and  so  on.  From  these  approximations,  we  have  a  nonlinear

1  Adaptive  Networks 
Much  of the  recent  excitement  about  neural  network  models  of computation  has  been  driven  by  the  prospect  of new  architectures  for  fine  grained  parallel  compu(cid:173) tation using analog VLSI.  Adaptive systems are espescially good targets for  analog  VLSI because the ada.ptive process  can compensate for  the inaccuracy of individual  devices  as easily as for  the variability of the signal.  However, silicon  VLSI  does  not  provide  us  with  an  ideal solution  for  weight  storage.  Among  the  properties  of an  ideal storage technology for  analog VLSI  adaptive systems  are: 
•  The minimum available weight change ~w must be small.  The simplest adap(cid:173)
tive  algorithms optimize  the  weights  by  minimizing  the  output  error  with  a  steepest  descent  search  in weight space  [1].  Iterative improvement algorithms  such  as  steepest  descent  are  based  on  the  heuristic  assumption  of  'better'  weights being found  in  the neighborhood of 'good' ones;  a  heuristic that fails  when  the granularity of the weights is  not fine  enough.  In the worst  case,  the  resolution required just to represent  a  function  can  grow exponentially in  the  dimension of the input space . 
•  The  weights  must be able  to represent  both  positive and negative values  and  the  changes  must  be easily  reversible.  Frequently,  the  weights  may cycle  up  and down while the adaptive process is converging and millions of incremental  changes  during  a  single  training session  is  not  unreasonable.  If the  weights  cannot easily  follow  all  of these  changes,  then  the  learning  must  be  done  off  chip.

This  net(cid:173) work  identifies  the  K  largest  of a  set  of N  real  numbers.  The  network  model used  is  the continuous Hopfield  model. 
I  - INTRODUCTION 
The Winner-Take-All  Network  is  a  network  which  identifies  the  largest  of N  real  numbers.  Winner-Take-All  Networks  have  been  developed  using  various  neural  networks models (Grossberg-73, Lippman-87, Feldman-82, Lazzaro-89).  We present  here  a  generalization  of the  Winner-Take-All  Network:  the  K-Winners-Take-All  (KWTA) Network.  The KWTA Network identifies the K  largest of N  real numbers.  The neural network model we  use throughout the paper is  the continuous Hopfield  network  model  (Hopfield-84).  If the states of the  N  nodes are initialized  to the N  real numbers, then, if the gain of the sigmoid is large enough, the network converges  to the state with  K  positive real numbers in  the positions of the nodes with  the K  largest  initial states, and  N  - K  negative  real  numbers everywhere else.  Consider  the  following  example:  N  = 4,  K  = 2.  There  are  6  =  (~)  stable  states:(++-)T, (++)T, (+--+)T, ( _ ++)T, (++)T, and (++)T.  If the initial  state of the  network  is  (0.3,  -0.4,  0.7,  O.l)T,  then  the network  will  converge to (Vi,V2,V3,v4)T  where Vi> 0,  V2  < 0,  V3  > 0,  V4  < 0  ((+ _ +_)T).  In Section II, we  define  the KWTA  Network (connection weights, external inputs).  In Section III,  we  analyze  the equilibrium states and  in  Section  IV,  we  identify  all  the stable equilibrium states of the KWTA Network.  In Section V, we  describe the  dynamics  of the  KWTA  Network.  In  Section  VI,  we  give  two  important examples  of the KWTA  Network and comment on an alternate implementation of the KWTA  Network.

II - THE K-WINNERS-TAKE-ALL  NETWORK 
The continuous Hopfield network model (Hopfield-84)  (also known as the Grossberg  additive model  (Grossberg-88)), is characterized by a system of first order differen(cid:173) tial equations which governs the evolution of the state of the network (i = 1, .. . , N) : 
The  sigmoid  function  g(u)  is  defined  by:  g(u)  = f(G·  u),  where  G  >  0  is  the  gain  of  the  sigmoid,  and  f(u)  is  defined  by:  1.  ""f/u,  0  <  f'(u)  <  f'(O)  = 1,  2.  limu .... +oo  f( u) = 1,  3.  limu .... -oo f( u) = -l.  The KWTA Network is characterized by mutually inhibitory interconnections Taj  =  -1  for  i  ¥=  j, a self connection Tai  = a,  (Ial < 1) and'an external input (identical  for  every node) which  depends on the number  K  of winners desired and the size of  the network  N  : ti = 2K - N.  The differential equations for  the KWTA  Network are therefore:

Mapping Classifier Systems Into Neural Networks,Lawrence Davis,1988,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/82aa4b0af34c2313a562076992e50aa3-Paper.pdf,"Classifier systems  are  machine  learning  systems  incotporating  a  genetic  al(cid:173)

"Training a Limited-Interconnect, Synthetic Neural IC","M. Walker, S. Haghighi, A. Afghan, Larry Akers",1988,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/8f53295a73878494e9bc8dd6c3c7104f-Paper.pdf,"Hardware implementation of neuromorphic algorithms is hampered by  high  degrees of connectivity.  Functionally equivalent feedforward  networks may be formed by using limited fan-in nodes and additional  layers.  but  this  complicates  procedures  for  determining  weight  magnitudes.  No direct mapping of weights exists between fully and  limited-interconnect  nets.  Low-level  nonlinearities  prevent  the  formation  of internal  representations  of widely  separated  spatial  features and the use of gradient descent methods to minimize output  error is hampered by error magnitude dissipation.  The judicious use  of linear summations or collection units is proposed as a solution. 
HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF FEEDFORWARD, 
SYNTHETIC NEURAL SYSTEMS 
The pursuit of hardware implementations of artificial neural network models is motivated  by the need to develop  systems which are capable of executing neuromorphic algorithms  in  real  time.  The most significant barrier is  the  high  degree  of connectivity  required  between the processing elements.  Current interconnect technology does not support the  direct  implementation  of  large-scale  arrays  of  this  type.  In  particular.  the  high  fan-in/fan-outs  of biology  impose  connectivity  requirements  such  that  the  electronic  implementation  of a  highly  interconnected biological  neural  networks  of just a  few  thousand neurons would require a level of connectivity which exceeds the current or even  projected interconnection density ofULSI systems (Akers et al.  1988). 
Highly layered. limited-interconnected architectures are however. especially well suited for  VLSI  implementations.  In  previous  works.  we  analyzed  the  generalization  and  fault-tolerance characteristics of a limited-interconnect perceptron architecture applied in  three simple mappings between binary input space and binary output space and proposed a  CMOS architecture (Akers and Walker. 1988).  This paper concentrates on developing an  understanding  of the limitations on  layered  neural  network  architectures  imposed by  hardware implementation and a proposed solution.

TRAINING CONSIDERATIONS FOR 
LIMITED .. INTERCONNECT FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS 
The symbolic layout of the limited fan-in  network is shown in Fig.  1.  Re-arranging of  the individual input components is done to eliminate edge effects.  Greater detail on the  actual  hardware architecture may be found  in  (Akers and Walker,  1988)  As  in  linear  filters,  the  total  number  of connections  which  fan-in  to  a  given  processing  element  determines the degrees of freedom available for forming a hypersurface which implements  the desired node output function (Widrow and Stearns, 1985).  When processing elements  with fixed, low fan-in are employed, the affects of reduced  degrees of freedom  must be  considered in order to develop workable training methods which permit generalization of  novel  inputs.  First. no  direct or indirect relation  exists  between  weight  magnitudes  obtained for a limited-interconnect, multilayered perceptron, and those obtained for  the  fully connected case.  Networks of these types adapted with identical exemplar sets must  therefore fonn  completely different functions  on  the input  space.  Second,  low-level  nonlinearities prevent direct internal  coding of widely  separated spatial features  in  the  input set.  A related problem  arises  when hyperplane nonlinearities are used.  Multiple  hyperplanes required on a subset of input space are impossible when no two second level  nodes  address  identical positions  in  the  input  space.  Finally,  adaptation  methods  like  backpropagation which minimize output error with gradient descent are hindered since the  magnitude of the error is dissipated as it back-propagates through large numbers of hidden  layers.  The appropriate placement of linear summation elements or collection  units is a  proposed solution.

The network uses the  pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-l,  together with element t, to predict element t+ 1. When the network is  trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn  to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses  of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode  prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through  the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses  performed at different points during training. 
Several connectionist architectures that are explicitly constrained to capture  sequential infonnation have been developed. Examples are Time Delay  Networks (e.g. Sejnowski & Rosenberg. 1986) -- also called 'moving  window' paradigms -- or algorithms such as back-propagation in time  (Rumelhart. Hinton & Williams. 1986), Such architectures use explicit  representations of several consecutive events. if not of the entire history of  past inputs. Recently. Elman (1988) has introduced a simple recurrent  network (SRN) that has the potential to master an infinite corpus of  sequences with the limited means of a learning procedure that is completely  local in time (see Figure I.).

Two general types of inhibition mediate activity in neural systems: subtractive in(cid:173) hibition, which sets a zero level for the computation, and multiplicative (nonlinear)  inhibition, which regulates the gain of the computation.

THE WINNER-TAKE-ALL CmCUIT 
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the winner-take-all circuit. A single wire, asso(cid:173) ciated with the potential Vc, computes the inhibition for the entire circuit; for an  n neuron circuit, this wire is O(n) long. To compute the global inhibition, each  neuron k contributes a current onto this common wire, using transistor T2 a.' To  apply this global inhibition locally, each neuron responds to the common wire volt(cid:173) age Vc, using transistor Tla.' This computation is continuous in time; no clocks  are used. The circuit exhibits no hysteresis, and operates with a time constant  related to the size of the largest input. The output representation of the circuit  is not binary; the winning output encodes the logarithm of its associated input. 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the winner-take-all circuit. Each neuron receives  a unidirectional current input 11;; the output voltages VI •.. VB represent the result  of the winner-take-all computation. If II; = max(II ••• IB ), then VI; is a logarithmic  function of 11;; if Ii <: 11;, then Vi ~ O. 
A static and dynamic ana.lysis of the two-neuron circuit illustrates these system  properties. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of a two-neuron winner-take-all  circuit. To understand the beha.vior of the circuit, we first consider the input  condition II = 12 = 1m. Transistors TIl ~d T12 have identical potentials at gate  and source, and are both sinking 1m; thus, the drain potentials VI and V2 must be  equal. Transistors T21 and T22 have identical source, drain, and gate potentials,  and therefore must sink the identical current ICI = IC2 = Ic/2. In the subthreshold  region of operation, the equation 1m = 10 exp(Vc/Vo) describes transistors Til and  T12 , where 10 is a fabrication parameter, and Vo = kT/qlt. Likewise, the equation  Ic/2 = 10 exp((Vm - Vel/Volt where Vm = VI = V2, describes transistors T21 and  T22 . Solving for Vm(Im, Ie) yields 
Vm = Voln(~:) + Voln(:;).

In this paper we consider its utility  as a spurious-free content-addressable memory, and provide bounds on  its performance in this context. We show how to exploit the machine's  ability to escape local minima, in order to use it, at a constant  temperature, for unambiguous associative pattern-retrieval in noisy  environments. An association rule, which creates a sphere of influence  around each stored pattern, is used along with the Machine's dynamics  to match the machine's noisy input with one of the pre-stored patterns.  Spurious fIxed points, whose regions of attraction are not recognized by  the rule, are skipped, due to the Machine's fInite probability to escape  from any state. The results apply to the Boltzmann machine and to the  asynchronous net of binary threshold elements (Hopfield model'). They  provide the network designer with worst-case and best-case bounds for  the network's performance, and allow polynomial-time tradeoff studies  of design parameters.

The lower level  is  a  two-dimensional  diffusion map which  accepts  visual  features  as  input, and spreads activity over larger scales as a function of time.

STOCHASTIC VERSUS MEAN FIELD 
In combinatorial optimization problems, an objective function or Hamiltonian,  H(s), is presented which depends on a vector of interacting 3pim, S = {81,"" .,8N},  in some complex nonlinear way. Stochastic simulated annealing (SSA) (S. Kirk(cid:173) patrick, C. Gelatt, and M. Vecchi (1983)) finds a global minimum of H by com(cid:173) bining gradient descent with a random process. This combination allows, under  certain conditions, choices of s which actually increa3e H, thus providing SSA with  a mechanism for escaping from local minima. The frequency and severity of these  uphill moves is reduced by slowly decreasing a parameter T (often referred to as  the temperature) such that the system settles into a global optimum. 
Two conceptual operationo; are involved in simulated annealing: a thermodatic op(cid:173) eration which schedules decreases in the temperature, and a relazation operation

We have tested this assumption in the hippocampus,  a cortical structure or the brain that is involved in long-term memory. A brier,  high-frequency activation or excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces an  increase in synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation, or L TP (BUss and  Lomo, 1973), that can last ror many days. LTP is known to be Hebbian since it  requires the simultaneous release or neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals  coupled with postsynaptic depolarization (Kelso et al, 1986; Malinow and Miller,  1986; Gustatrson et al, 1987). However, a mechanism ror the persistent reduction or  synaptic strength that could balance LTP has not yet been demonstrated. We stu(cid:173) died the associative interactions between separate inputs onto the same dendritic  trees or hippocampal pyramidal cells or field CAl, and round that a low-frequency  input which, by itselr, does not persistently change synaptic strength, can either  increase (associative L TP) or decrease in strength (associative long-term depression  or LTD) depending upon whether it is positively or negatively correlated in time  with a second, high-frequency bursting input. LTP or synaptic strength is Hebbian,  and LTD is anti-Hebbian since it is elicited by pairing presynaptic firing with post(cid:173) synaptic hyperpolarization sufficient to block postsynaptic activity.

LEARNING BY STATE RECURRENCE DETECTION,"Bruce Rosen, James Goodwin, Jacques Vidal",1987,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/182be0c5cdcd5072bb1864cdee4d3d6e-Paper.pdf,"This research investigates a new technique for unsupervised learning of nonlinear  control problems. The approach is applied both to Michie and Chambers BOXES  algorithm and to Barto, Sutton and Anderson's extension, the ASE/ACE system, and  has significantly improved the convergence rate of stochastically based learning  automata. 
Recurrence learning is a new nonlinear reward-penalty algorithm. It exploits  information found during learning trials to reinforce decisions resulting in the  recurrence of nonfailing states. Recurrence learning applies positive reinforcement  during the exploration of the search space, whereas in the BOXES or ASE algorithms,  only negative weight reinforcement is applied, and then only on failure. Simulation  results show that the added information from recurrence learning increases the learning  rate. 
Our empirical results show that recurrence learning is faster than both basic failure  driven learning and failure prediction methods. Although recurrence learning has only  been tested in failure driven experiments, there are goal directed learning applications  where detection of recurring oscillations may provide useful information that reduces  the learning time by applying negative, instead of positive reinforcement. 
Detection of cycles provides a heuristic to improve the balance between evidence 
gathering and goal directed search.

A method  is  proposed  that  allows  an implementation of neural  network  connections  on  massively parallel SIMD  architectures.

The memory capac1ty Is found to be much smal1er than  the Kosko upper bound, which Is the lesser of the two dimensions of the  BAM.

The memory capacity limitations are due to spurious stable  states, which arise In BAMs In much the same way as in Hopfleld  memories. Occurrence of spurious stable states can be avoided by  replacing the thresholding in the backlayer of the BAM by another  nonl1near process, here called ""Dominant Label Selection"" (DLS).

As  previous authors have mentioned,  there is  no such guarantee for  classification tasks.  We  will begin by  presenting explicit counter(cid:173) examples illustrating two different interesting ways in which  the delta rule can fail.  We  go on  to provide conditions  which  do guarantee  that gradient  descent  will  successfully  train  networks  without  hidden  units  to  perform  two-category  classification  tasks.  We  discuss  the  generalization  of our  ideas  to  networks  with  hidden  units  and  to  multi(cid:173) category classification  tasks. 
The Classification Task 
Consider  networks  of the form  indicated  in  figure  1.  We  discuss  various  methods  for  training such  a  network,  that is  for  adjusting its weight  vector,  w.  If we  call  the input  v, the output is  g(w· v), where 9 is  some function. 
The classification  task we  wish  to train the network  to perform is  the following.  Given  two finite sets of vectors,  Fl  and F2, output a number greater than zero when a vector in  Fl  is input, and output a number less than zero when a  vector in  F2  is input.  Without  significant loss of generality, we  assume that 9 is odd (Le.  g( -s) ==  -g( s».  In that case,  the task can be reformulated  as follows.  Define  2 
F  :==  Fl  U {-v such  that v  E F2}

and  output  a  number  greater  than  zero  when  a  vector  in  F  is  input.  The  former  formulation is  more natural in some sense,  but the later formulation is  somewhat  more  convenient  for  analysis  and is  the one we  use.  We  call  vectors in  F,  training  vectors.

Here we demonstrate that two-layer perceptron classifiers trained with back propagation

rapidly,  and  provide  good  performance  with  simple  decision  regions.  When  complex

performance is  often no better than that of k-nearest  neighbor classifiers.  Three neural

Two use  fixed  weights in  the  first  one  or  two layers and  are  similar  to classifiers  that

The  representation  saturates  gracefully  as  larger  structures  are  represented;  it penn its  recursive  construction  of complex  representations  from  simpler  ones;  it  respects  the  independence  of the  capacities  to generate and  maintain  multiple bindings in  parallel;  it  extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it pennits values to  also  serve  as  variables;  it  enables  analysis  of  the  interference  of  symbolic  structures  stored  in  associative  memories;  and  it  leads  to characterization  of optimal  distributed representations  of roles  and a recirculation algorithm for learning them.

Learning a Color Algorithm from Examples,"Tomaso A.

The algorithm, which re(cid:173) sembles a new lightness algorithm recently proposed by Land, is approximately equiva(cid:173) lent to filtering the image through a center-surround receptive field in individual chro(cid:173) matic channels. The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only  one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear. This  assumption is true for a certain class of early vision algorithms that may therefore be  synthesized in a similar way from examples. Other methods of synthesizing algorithms  from examples, or ""learning"", such as backpropagation, do not yield a significantly dif(cid:173) ferent or better lightness algorithm in the Mondrian world. The linear estimation and  backpropagation techniques both produce simultaneous brightness contrast effects. 
The problems that a visual system must solve in decoding two-dimensional images  into three-dimensional scenes (inverse optics problems) are difficult: the information  supplied by an image is not sufficient by itself to specify a unique scene. To reduce  the number of possible interpretations of images, visual systems, whether artificial  or biological, must make use of natural constraints, assumptions about the physical  properties of surfaces and lights. Computational vision scientists have derived effective  solutions for some inverse optics problems (such as computing depth from binocular  disparity) by determining the appropriate natural constraints and embedding them in  algorithms. How might a visual system discover and exploit natural constraints on its  own? We address a simpler question: Given only a set of examples of input images and  desired output solutions, can a visual system synthesize. or ""learn"", the algorithm that  converts input to output? We find that an algorithm for computing color in a restricted  world can be constructed from examples using standard techniques of optimal linear  estimation. 
The computation of color is a prime example of the difficult problems of inverse  optics. We do not merely discriminate betwN'n different wavelengths of light; we assign

roughly constant colors to objects even though the light signals they send to our eyes  change as the illumination varies across space and chromatic spectrum. The compu(cid:173) tational goal underlying color constancy seems to be to extract the invariant surface  spectral reflectance properties from the image irradiance, in which reflectance and iI-""  lumination are mixed 1 • 
Lightness algorithms 2-8, pioneered by Land, assume that the color of an object 
can be specified by its lightness, or relative surface reflectance, in each of three inde(cid:173) pendent chromatic channels, and that lightness is computed in the same way in each  channel. Computing color is thereby reduced to extracting surface reflectance from the  image irradiance in a single chromatic channel. 
The image irra.diance, s', is proportional to the product of the illumination inten(cid:173)
sity e' and the surface reflectance r' in that channel: 
(1 )  This form of the image intensity equation is true for a Lambertian reflectance model,  in which the irradiance s' has no specular components, and for appropriately chosen  color channels 9. Taking the logarithm of both sides converts it to a sum: 
s' (x, y) = r' (x, y )e' (x, y). 
s(x, y) = rex, y) + e(x,y),

where s = loges'), r = log(r') and e = log(e'). 
Given s(x,y) alone, the problem of solving Eq. 2 for r(x,y) is underconstrained.  Lightness algorithms constrain the problem by restricting their domain to a world of  Mondrians, two-dimensional surfaces covered with patches of random colors2 and by  exploiting two constraints in that world: (i) r'(x,y) is unifonn within patches but  has sharp discontinuities at edges between patches and (ii) e' (x, y) varies smoothly  across the Mondrian. Under these constraints, lightness algorithms can recover a good  approximation to r( x, y) and so can recover lightness triplets that label roughly constant  colors 10. 
We ask whether it is possible to synthesize from examples an algorithm that ex· 
tracts reflectance from image irradiance. and whether the synthesized algorithm will re(cid:173) semble existing lightness algorithms derived from an explicit analysis of the constraints.  We make one assumption, that the operator that transforms irradiance into reflectance  is linear. Under that assumption, motivated by considerations discussed later, we use  optimal linear estimation techniques to synthesize an operator from examples. The  examples are pairs of images: an input image of a Mondrian under illumination that  varies smoothly across space and its desired output image that displays the reflectance  of the Mondrian without the illumination. The technique finds the linear estimator  that best maps input into desired output. in the least squares sense. 
For computational convenience we use one-dimensional ""training vectors"" that  represent vertical scan lines across the ~londrian images (Fig. 1). We generate many

An important property of the model  is  that  it always  converges  to a  stable state  when  operating in  a  serial  mode [2,5].  This property is  the basis of the potential applications of the  model such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization  [3,6].  One of the motivations for use of the model for solving hard combinatorial  problems  is  the fact  that it can  be implemented  by optical devices  and  thus operate at a  higher speed  than conventional electronics.  The main theme in this work is  to investigate the power of the model for  solving NP-hard problems  [4,8],  and to understand  the relation  between  speed of operation and the size of a  neural network.  In particular, it will  be  shown  that  for  any  NP-hard  problem  the  existence  of a  polynomial  size  network  that  solves  it  implies  that  NP=co-NP.  Also,  for  Traveling  Salesman  Problem  (TSP), even  a  polynomial  size  network  that  gets  an  €-approximate  solution does  not exist unless  P=NP.

established (·automatic·) strategies. Conscious strategies are slow  but flexible (offer wide choice), automatic strategies are fast but  rigid. 
Examples for functional states on a gross scale are wakefulness,  drowsin.ss and sleep in adults, or developmental stages as infancy,  childhood and adolesc.nce, or drug states induced by alcohol or  other psychoactive agent •• The different states are associated with  distinctly different ways of information processing. For example, in  normal adults, reality-close, abstracting strategies based on causal  relationships predominate during wakefulness, whereas in drowsiness  and sleep (dreams), reality-remote, visualizing, associative  concatenations of contents are used. Other well-known examples are  drug states. 
HUMAN BRAIN ELECTRIC FIELD DATA AND STATES 
While alive, the brain produces an ever-changing el.ctromagnetic 
fi.ld, which very sensitively reflects global and local states as  effected by spontaneous activity, incoming information, metabolism,  drugs, and diseases. The .lectric component of the brain~s electro(cid:173) magnetic field as non-invasively measured from the intact human  scalp shows voltages between 0.1 and 250 microVolts, temporal  fr.quencies between 0.1 and 30, 100 or 3000 Hz depending on the  examined function, and spatial frequencies up to 0.2 cycles/em. 
Brain electric field data are traditionally viewed as time series 
of potential differences betwe.n two scalp locations (the  electroencephalogram or EE6). Time series analysis has offered an  effective way to class different gross brain functional states,  typically using EE6 power spectral values. Differences between power  spectra during different gross states typically are greater than  between different locations. States of lesser functional complexity  such as childhood vs adult states, sleep vs wakefulness, and many  drug-state. vs non-drug states tend to increased power in slower  frequencies (e.g. 1,4). 
Time series analyses of epochs of intermediate durations between 
30 and 10 seconds have demonstrated (e.g. 1,5,6) that there are  significant and reliable relations between spectral power or  coh.rency values of EE6 and characteristics of human mentation  (reality-close thoughts vs free associations, visual vs non-visual  thoughts, po.itive vs negative ~otions). 
Viewing brain electric field data as series of momentary field 
maps (7,8) opens the possibility to investigate the temporal  microstructure of brain functional states in the sub-second range.  The rationale is that the momentary configuration of activated  neural elements represents a given brain functional state, and that  the spatial pattern of activation is reflected by the momentary  brain electric field which is recordable on the scalp as a momentary  field map. Different configurations of activation (different field  maps) are expected to be associated with different modes,  strategies, steps and contents of information processing. 
SE(J1ENTATI~ OF BRAIN ELECTRIC HAP SERIES INTO STABLE SE(J1ENTS 
469 
When Viewing brain electric activity as series of maps of 
momentary potential distributions, changes of functional state are  recognizable as changes of the ·electric landscapes· of these maps.  Typically, several successive maps show similar landscapes, then  quickly change to a new configuration which again tends to persist  for a number of successive maps, suggestive of stable states  concatenated by non-linear transitions (9,10). Stable map landscapes  might be hypothesized to indicate the basic building blocks of  information processing in the brain, the -atoms of thoughts·. Thus,  the task at hand is the recognition of the landscape configurations;  this leads to the adaptive segmentation of time series of momentary  maps into segments of stable landscapes during varying durations. 
We have proposed and used a method which describes the 
configuration of a momentary map by the locations of its maximal and  minimal potential values, thus invoking a dipole model. The goal  here is the phenomenological recognition of different momentary  functional states using a very limited number of major map features  as classifiers, and we suggest conservative interpretion of the data  as to real brain locations of the generating processes which always  involve millions of neural elements. 
We have studied (11) map series recorded from 16 scalp locations 
over posterior skull areas from normal subjects during relaxation  with closed eyes. For adaptive segmentation, the maps at the times  of maximal map relief were selected for optimal signal/nOise  conditions. The locations of the maximal and minimal (extrema)  potentials were extracted in each map as descriptors of the  landscape; taking into account the basically periodic nature of  spontaneous brain electric activity (Fig. 1), extrema locations were  treated disregarding polarity information. If over time an extreme  left its pre-set spatial window (say, one electrode distance), the  segment was terminated. The map series showed stable map  configurations for varying durations (Fig. 2), and discontinuous,  step-wise changes. Over 6 subjects, resting alpha-type EEG showed  210 msec mean segment duration; segments longer than 323 msec  covered 50% of total time; the most prominent segment class (1.5% of  all classes) covered 20% of total time (prominence varied strongly  over classes; not all possible classes occurred). Spectral power and  phase of averages of adaptive and pre-determined segments  demonstrated the adequacy of the strategy and the homogeneity of  adaptive segment classes by their reduced within-class variance.  Segmentation using global map dissimilarity (sum of Euklidian  difference vs average reference at all measured points) emulates the  results of the extracted-characteristics-strategy. 
FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF MOMENTARY MICRO STATES 
Since different maps of momentary EEG fields imply activity of 
different neural populations, different segment classes must  manifest different brain functional states with expectedly different

Simulations Suggest Information Processing Roles for the Diverse Currents in Hippocampal Neurons,Lyle Borg-Graham,1987,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/9778d5d219c5080b9a6a17bef029331c-Paper.pdf,"A computer model of the hippocampal pyramidal cell (HPC) is  described

However,  it is  becoming clear that  the role  of these channels  may  be much  more complex, resulting in a variety of novel ""computational operators"" that  reflect  the information  processing occurring in  the biological neural  net.

2  Modelling  Hippocampal Neurons 
Over the  past  decade  a  wide  variety of non-linear  ion channels,  have  been  described  for  many  excitable  cells,  in  particular  several  kinds  of neurons.  One  such  neuron  is  the  hippocampal  pyramidal  cell  (HPC).  HPC  chan(cid:173) nels  are  marked  by  their  wide  range  of temporal,  voltage-dependent,  and  chemical-dependent characteristics,  which  results  in very complex  behavior  or  responses  of these  stereotypical  cortical  integrating cells.  For example,  some HPC channels are activated (opened)  transiently and quickly, thus pri(cid:173) marily affecting  the action  potential shape.  Other channels  have longer  ki(cid:173) netics, modulating the response of HPCs over hundreds of milliseconds.  The  measurement  these  channels  is  hampered  by  various  technical  constraints,  including the small size and extended electrotonic structure of HPCs and the  diverse  preparations  used  in experiments.  Modelling the electrical  behavior  of HPCs  with computer simulations is  one method  of integrating data from  a  variety of sources in order to develop  a  consistent description for  this  cell  type. 
In the model referred to here putative mechanisms for  voltage-dependent 
and  calcium-dependent  channel gating  have  been  used  to generate  simula(cid:173) tions of the somatic electrical behavior of HPCs, and to suggest mechanisms  for  information processing at  the single cell  level.  The model  has  also  been  used  to suggest experimental protocols  designed  to test  the validity of sim(cid:173) ulation results.  Model simulations qualitatively or quantitatively reproduce  a  wide  range of somatic electrical behavior in HPCs, and  explicitly  demon(cid:173) strate possible functional  roles  for  the various currents [1]. 
The model  presently includes  descriptions  of eleven  non-linear somatic  currents,  including  three  putative  N a+  currents  - INa-trig,  INa-rep,  and  INa-tail;  six  K+  currents  that  have  been  reported  in  the  literature - IDR  (Delayed  Rectifier),  lA,  Ie,  IAHP  (After-hyperpolarization),  1M,  and  IQ;  and two Ca2+ currents, also reported  previously - lea  and  leas. 
The  electrotonic  structure  of the  HPC  is  modelled  with  a  soma/short(cid:173)
cable approximation, and  the dendrites are assumed to be linear.  While the  conditions  for  reducing  the dendritic  tree  to a  single  cable are  not  met  for  HPC  (the so-called Rall conditions  [3]),  the  Zin  of the cable is  close  to that  of the tree.  In addition, although HPC dendrites have non-linear membrane,  it  assumed  that  as  a  first  approximation  the contribution of currents  from  this membrane may be ignored in the somatic response  to somatic stimulus.  Likewise,  the  model structure assumes  that axon-soma current  under these  conditions can be lumped into the soma circuit.

In  part  this  paper  will  address  the  following  question:  if  neural  nets 
are realizable using elements that  have simple integrative all-or-nothing re(cid:173) sponses,  connected  to each other  with  regenerative  conductors,  then  what  is  the function  for all  the channels observed experimentally in real neurons?  The results  of this  HPC  model study suggest  some  purpose for  these com(cid:173) plexities, and in this  paper we  shall investigate some of the possible roles  of  non-linear channels in neuronal information processing.  However, given the  speculative  nature  of many of the  currents  that  we  have  presented  in  the  model, it is  important to view  results  based  on  the interaction of the many  model  elements as  preliminary.

Determination of computational properties  of neurons  requires  a  priori as(cid:173) sumptions  as  to how information is  encoded in  neuronal  output.  The clas(cid:173) sical  description  assumes  that  information  is  encoded  as  spike  frequency.  However,  a  single  output variable,  proportional to firing  frequency,  ignores  other potentially information-rich degrees  of freedom,  including: 
•  Relative phase of concurrent inputs. 
•  Frequency modulation during single  bursts. 
•  Cessation of firing  due to intrinsic mechanisms.

Correlational Strength and Computational Algebra of Synaptic Connections Between Neurons,Eberhard Fetz,1987,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/9bf31c7ff062936a96d3c8bd1f8f2ff3-Paper.pdf,"Intracellular  recordings  in  spinal  cord  motoneurons  and  cerebral  cortex neurons have provided new evidence on the correlational strength of  monosynaptic  connections,  and  the  relation  between  the  shapes  of  postsynaptic  potentials  and  the  associated  increased  firing  probability.  In  these  cells,  excitatory  postsynaptic  potentials  (EPSPs)  produce  cross(cid:173) correlogram peaks  which resemble  in large part the derivative of  the EPSP.  Additional  synaptic  noise broadens  the peak,  but the  peak  area  -- i.e.,  the  number of above-chance firings triggered per EPSP -- remains proportional to  the EPSP  amplitude.  A typical EPSP of 100  ~v triggers about .01  firings per  EPSP.  The  consequences  of  these  data  for  information  processing  by  polysynaptic connections is discussed.  The effects of sequential polysynaptic  links  can  be  calculated  by  convolving  the  effects  of  the  underlying  monosynaptic connections.  The net effect of parallel pathways is the sum of  the individual contributions.

Optimizations using energy methods yield ""forces"" which  act upon  the  state of the  neural  network.  The penalty method, in which quadratic  energy  constraints  are  added  to  an  existing  optimization  energy,  has  become  popular  recently,  but  is  not  guaranteed  to satisfy  the  constraint conditions  when  there  are  other forces  on  the  neural  model  or when  there  are  multiple constraints.  In this paper, we present the basic differential multiplier method (BDMM),  which  satisfies constraints exactly;  we  create forces  which gradually apply  the constraints over time,  using ""neurons"" that estimate Lagrange multipliers. 
The  basic  differential  multiplier  method  is  a  differential  version  of the  method  of multipliers  from  Numerical Analysis.  We  prove  that the differential  equations locally converge  to  a constrained  minimum.

Temporal Patterns of Activity in Neural Networks,Paolo Gaudiano,1987,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/c51ce410c124a10e0db5e4b97fc2af39-Paper.pdf,"Patterns  of activity  over  real  neural  structures  are  known  to  exhibit  time(cid:173)
dependent  behavior.  It  would  seem  that  the  brain  may  be  capable  of utilizing  temporal  behavior of activity in neural  networks as  a  way  of performing functions  which cannot otherwise be easily implemented.  These might include the origination  of sequential behavior and  the  recognition  of time-dependent  stimuli.  A  model  is  presented  here  which  uses  neuronal  populations  with  recurrent  feedback  connec(cid:173) tions in an attempt to observe and describe  the resulting time-dependent behavior.  Shortcomings and problems inherent  to  this model are  discussed.  Current models  by other  researchers  are  reviewed  and their similarities and differences  discussed. 
METHODS  /  PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
In previous  papers,[2,3]  computer models  were  presented  that  simulate a  net  con(cid:173)
sisting of two spatially organized populations of realistic neurons.  The populations are  richly  interconnected  and  are  shown  to  exhibit  internally  sustained  activity.  It  was  shown that if the neurons have response times significantly shorter than the typical unit  time characteristic of the input  patterns  (usually  1 msec),  the populations will exhibit  time-dependent behavior.  This will typically result in the net falling into a  limit cycle.  By a limit cycle, it is meant that the population falls into activity patterns during which  all of the active cells  fire  in  a  cyclic,  periodic  fashion.  Although  the period of firing  of  the individual  cells  may be  different,  after  a  fixed  time  the  overall population activity  will  repeat  in  a  cyclic,  periodic  fashion.  For  populations  organized  in  7x7  grids,  the  limit  cycle  will  usually  start  20~200 msec  after  the input  is  turned off,  and  its period  will be in  the order of 20-100  msec. 
The point ofinterest is that ifthe net is allowed to undergo synaptic modifications by  means  of a  modified  hebbian learning rule  while being presented with a  specific  spatial  pattern (i.e., cells at  specific  spatial locations within the net are externally stimulated),  subsequent  presentations  of the  same  pattern  with  different  temporal  characteristics  will cause the population to recall patterns which are spatially identical (the same cells  will be active)  but which have different  temporal qualities.  In other words, the net can  fall  into a  different  limit  cycle.  These limit cycles  seem  to behave as  attractors in that  similar input  patterns will result  in  the  same limit cycle,  and hence  each distinct limit  cycle  appears  to have a  basin of attraction.  Hence a  net  which can  only learn a  small

number  of spatially  distinct  patterns  can recall  the  patterns in a  number  of temporal  modes.  If it were possible to quantitatively discriminate between such temporal modes,  it  would  seem  reasonable  to  speculate  that  different  limit  cycles  could  correspond  to  different  memory traces.  This would  significantly increase estimates on the  capacity of  memory  storage in the net. 
It has  also been shown that a net being presented with a  given pattern will fall and  stay  into  a  limit  cycle  until another  pattern is  presented  which  will  cause  the  system  to fall  into a  different  basin of attraction.  If no other  patterns  are presented,  the  net  will remain in  the  same limit  cycle  indefinitely.  Furthermore, the net  will fall  into the  same  limit  cycle  independently  of the  duration  of the  input  stimulus,  so  long  as  the  input stimulus is  presented for  a  long enough time to raise the population activity level  beyond  a  minimum necessary  to  achieve  self-sustained  activity.  Hence,  if we  suppose  that  the  net  ""recognizes""  the input  when  it  falls  into the  corresponding  limit  cycle,  it  follows  that the net will recognize a string of input patterns regardless of the duration of  each input pattern, so long as each input is presented long enough for the net  to fall into  the  appropriate limit  cycle.  In particular,  our  system is  capable of falling  into  a  limit  cycle within some tens of milliseconds.  This can be fast enough to encode, for example, a  string of phonemes as would typically be found in continuous speech.  It may be possible,  for  instance,  to create a  model  similar  to Rumelhart  and McClelland's  1981  model  on  word recognition by appropriately connecting multiple layers  of these networks.  If the  response  time  of the  cells  were  increased  in  higher  layers,  it may  be  possible  to have  the  lowest  level  respond  to  stimuli  quickly  enough  to  distinguish  phonemes  (or  some  sub-phonemic basic linguistic unit), then have populations from this first  level feed  into  a  slower,  word-recognizing population layer,  and  so  On.  Such a  model  may  be  able  to  perform word  recognition from an input  consisting of continuous phoneme strings even  when  the phonemes  may vary in duration of presentation.
